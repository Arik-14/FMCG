# Problem statement:-
AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.

# Project Overview:-
1.	Analysed data from AtliQ Mart's internal databases.
2.	Performed SQL queries to fulfil business requests.
3.	Insights are intended to start broaden analysis to discover valuable findings.

## Business Requests:-
1.Provide a list of products with a base price greater than 500 and that are featured in promo type of ‘BOGOF’(Buy One Get One Free).This information will help us identify     high-value products that are currently being heavily discounted, which can be useful for evaluating our pricing and promotion strategies.![image](https://github.com/Arik-14/FMCG/assets/142299250/9c53c36b-bbdc-4ac6-a093-418a2bebd0de)
